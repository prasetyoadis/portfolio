1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Her existence was hidden from everyone.

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.539
This is Violet.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.060
Say your greetings.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.060
Affirmative.

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.180
She's just a kid.

6
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.380
Despite her doll-like outfit,

7
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.740
she had the demeanor...

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.580
of a military soldier.

9
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.040
I want to stop your tears.

10
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.660
You are just an emotionless tool, so,

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.159
how could you be sad?

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.340
The major’s brother once told me,

13
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.220
“You’re Gilbert’s dog.”

14
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.820
I’m the major’s tool.

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.780
But if he doesn’t need me anymore,

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.400
then I should be thrown away.

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.140
You really don’t understand other people’s feelings, do you?

18
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.000
I don’t understand.

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.519
I do not understand.

20
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.700
I want to know.

21
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.139
I want to know

22
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.540
what “I love you” means.

23
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.500
No way! There's no way I'm going to let you die!

24
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.920
Stop already!

25
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.020
I will not kill anyone.

26
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.040
I do not need a weapon.

27
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.400
Don't be a tool,

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.220
become someone that matches with their name.

29
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580
Live, and...

30
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460
be free.

31
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.440
From the bottom of my heart...

32
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.500
I love you.
